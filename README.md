# Database connection

Database support is set up using [Objection.js](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/), an ORM built on top of [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/)

The *database* folder contains Base (a base orm class), a .txt file with related commands, and a 
*knex* folder

The *knex* folder contains migrations, seeds, and files for obtaining a Knex instances, one based on the configuration in knexfile.js and the other a test instance that utilizes an in-memory sqlite database.

*knex/migrations* contains schema definitions for our application.

### Example of using the database connection

```javascript
const knex = require('./database/knex/knex');
const Base = require('./database/base');

// Base must be set up to use a Knex instance
Base.knex(knex);
```

# Server

This project contains an API server written using [express.js](http://expressjs.com/). This API can be used to get data from and change data in a SmartHomeApp instance.

The code for this server can be found in *app.js*

### How to run

```bash
npm start
```

OR

```bash
node app.js
```

### Endpoints

GET '/': Text response confirming the operation of the server

GET '/speechToText': *speech-to-text.html* file

GET '/app': JSON response showing SmartHomeApp instance

GET '/app/reload': Reloads the SmartHomeApp instance from the database.

GET '/app/add/:type': Adds a SmartAppliance object to the SmartHomeApp instance. SmartAppliance type is based on the *:type* parameter. Currently supported types are 'camera', 'thermometer', and 'light'. 

GET '/app/remove/:id': Removes the SmartAppliance instance with id *:id* from the SmartHomeApp instance.

GET '/app/removeAll': Removes all SmartAppliance instances from the SmartHomeApp instance.

GET '/app/:id/:func': Executes method *func* on the SmartAppliance instance with id *id*. E.g. '/app/2/powerOn' is equivalent to smartAppliance2.powerOn(). This can be used to execute methods that don't require any arguments.

GET '/app/:id': JSON response showing SmartAppliance instance with id *id*

POST '/app/:id/addNotification': Adds a Notification instance to the SmartAppliance instance with id *:id*. The query parameter is *info* (the notification message). E.g. '/app/1/addNotification?info=This is a test notification!'.

POST '/app/:id': Query parameters are *instanceVar* (instance variable to set) and *val* (value to use). Sets the *instanceVar* of the SmartAppliance instance with id *:id* to *val*. E.g. '/app/2?instanceVar=preferredTemp&val=70'.

DELETE '/app/:id/notifications/:notifId': Deletes the Notification instance with id *:notifId* from the SmartAppliance instance with id *id*.

#### Properties

**resolution (string)**: Represents the current resolution setting of the camera. It can be set to various resolution values to control the video quality.

**_isRecording (boolean)**: Indicates whether the camera is currently recording.

**_recordings (array)**: An array to store recorded video segments.

#### Methods

**startRecording()**: Initiates the recording process. If the camera is not already recording, it starts recording and logs a message.

**stopRecording()**: Stops the recording process. If the camera is currently recording, it stops the recording and logs a message.

**saveRecording(recording)**: Saves a recorded video segment. If the camera is recording, it adds the segment to the _recordings array and logs a message.

**playbackRecording(index)**: Initiates the playback of a recorded video segment. If the provided index is valid (within the range of recorded segments), it logs a message indicating the playback of the corresponding recording.

#### Usage

The camera class is designed to be a flexible and extensible component for managing smart cameras within your smart home system. You can control the camera's resolution, initiate recording, and stop recording, save recorded segments, and play back recordings.

### Light Class

The light class is a part of the Smart Home Hub system and extends the smart appliance class. It is designed to control home lighting and provides additional features, such as voice control and motion detection.

## Other Classes

### Microphone Class

1.	Creating a system where a mobile device can talk to another smart device involves several components, including acquiring audio from the microphone, encoding the audio, transmitting the audio, and then decoding and playing the audio on the receiving device. Example using JavaScript and WebRTC for audio communication between two devices in the same web application.

```javascript
class Microphone {
    constructor() {
        this.stream = null;
        this.mediaConstraints = { audio: true };
    }

    async getAudioStream() {
        if (!this.stream) {
            this.stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(this.mediaConstraints);
        }
        return this.stream;
    }

    stop() {
        if (this.stream) {
            this.stream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
            this.stream = null;
        }
    }
}
```

2.	Peer Connection: 

Using WebRTC's RTCPeerConnection for the communication:

```javascript
const pcConfig = {
    iceServers: [{ urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' }]
};

const localMicrophone = new Microphone();
const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection(pcConfig);

// When an ICE candidate is generated by the RTCPeerConnection
peerConnection.onicecandidate = (event) => {
    if (event.candidate) {
        // Send this candidate to the other device (e.g., using a signaling server)
    }
};

// To start the call:
async function startCall() {
    const localStream = await localMicrophone.getAudioStream();
    localStream.getTracks().forEach(track => peerConnection.addTrack(track, localStream));

    const offer = await peerConnection.createOffer();
    await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(offer);

    // Send `offer` to the other device (e.g., using a signaling server)
}

// On receiving an answer (from the other device):
function handleAnswer(answer) {
    peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(answer));
}

// On receiving an ICE candidate (from the other device):
function addIceCandidate(candidate) {
    peerConnection.addIceCandidate(new RTCIceCandidate(candidate));
}
```
Explanation:

3.	Signaling: This omits the signaling part, which is crucial for the devices to exchange SDP and ICE data. Signaling is often done using WebSocket or other messaging protocols.

4.	Receiving Device: The receiving device should create its own RTCPeerConnection, set the remote offer, generate an answer, and send that answer back. Also, when the RTCPeerConnection fires a track event, the received track should be attached to an audio element to be played.
